# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The Los Angeles Police Department's transition to an NIBRS-compliant crime and arrest reporting system

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. In comparison to the prior system, what effects has the implementation of the NIBRS-compliant reporting system had on the accuracy and quality of LAPD's crime and arrest data?
2. What patterns in crime categories and incident sites have LAPD documented since 2020, and are these patterns different under the new NIBRS system?
3. What is the impact on data reliability for public usage and decision-making of the regularity and consistency of LAPD data updates (weekly, bi-weekly, and possible interruptions)?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
To comply with the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) regulations, which seek to standardize the gathering of crime and arrest data across the country, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will introduce a new Records Management System. The community will gain better insights into local crime trends as a result of this move to NIBRS-only data, which will increase the accuracy, detail, and accessibility of Los Angeles crime data.

As LAPD works to create the new NIBRS-compatible datasets, users will initially only see occurrences that were logged in the retiring system during the transition. In an effort to preserve data accuracy, the department temporarily switched from weekly to bi-weekly updates due to recent problems providing crime data updates.
